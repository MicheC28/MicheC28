### Hi there 👋

Hi! I’m a computer engineering student who enjoys getting hands-on with tech. I’ve spent time programming Arduino and STM boards, playing around with digital data filters, and managing projects. I’m always curious and looking to dive deeper into embedded systems and software engineering. There’s always a new problem to solve or project to bring to life.

### My Repos 
Repository 1: Personal Portfolio Site
- I created a personal portfolio site to display my projects and experiences using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
- Deployed using Netlify.
- This is such a fun project that really allows my creativity to shine 🌟!
- One of the newest additions is a on the projects page, mimicing the Apple watch Bubble UI.

Repository 2: Online Clipboard 📋
- As my first web dev project, I created a chrome extension that allows uers to keep track of key sites' URLs as well as a small note to accompany them.

Repsitory 3: Rainy Riches Game 💸💸
- Designed and programmed a video game in Processing5 where users control a box to catch $$$ bills falling out of the sky.
- I built this back in quarantine when I first started learning programming. For a first project, I'm really proud of it.

### Technologies
 - Programming Languages: C++, Python3, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
 - Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, Scipy
 - STM32-NucleoF401RE Microcontroller, Arduino
 - Electronic components such as GPIO, ADC, DAC, I2C, DMA

### Certifications
- Python - Kaggle
- IBM Z Xplore - Concepts Badge
- Intro to Machine Learning - Kaggle
- Pandas - Kaggle

### Fun Facts! :D
- I'm left-handed.
- My hobbies include cooking and poor guitar playing 🎸🍽️.
